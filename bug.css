The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations. However, there's a common pitfall: forgetting to add spaces around the `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/` operators.  For example, the following code will likely not work as intended:

```css
.element { width:calc(100%-10px); }
```

The correct syntax requires spaces:

```css
.element { width: calc(100% - 10px); }
```

Without spaces, the browser might not parse the expression correctly, leading to unexpected layout issues.
